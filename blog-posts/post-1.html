            The printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five 
            centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s 
            with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem 
            Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            But because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter extremely painful consequences.
             Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
              because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take 
              a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?
               But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, 
               or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

            These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when
             nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in 
             certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures
              have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of
               selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
